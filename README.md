I am so pleased to be accepted for this very competitive internship with https://ChangingThePresent.org. This nonprofit helps channel to nonprofits some of the $450 billion that Americans spend each year on traditional birthday, wedding, and holiday presents. What a great chance to use my skills, assume responsibility, learn, and make a difference! If you are looking for an internship, please look at all the opportunities at https://ChangingThePresent.org/interns. There are many opportunities, including HR, analytics, web development, marketing, communication, social media, graphics, and every charitable cause.
